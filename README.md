REPOSITORY
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

BRANCHES  
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

COMMITS
Saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

PULL REQUESTS 
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.  By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

-Open a Pull Request for changes to the README
1  Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
2  In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).
3  Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
4  When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
5  Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
6  When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

-Merge Your Pull Request
In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.

1  Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
2  Click Confirm merge.
3  Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
